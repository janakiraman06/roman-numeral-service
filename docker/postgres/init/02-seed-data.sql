-- ============================================
-- Seed Data (runs after schema creation)
-- ============================================
-- Note: This script is idempotent - safe to run multiple times.
-- Tables are created by JPA on first app startup.
-- This script runs on container init, so tables may not exist yet.
-- Seed data will be inserted by the application's DataInitializer.
-- ============================================

-- Placeholder for future database-level seeding if needed.
-- Currently, seed data is managed by Spring's DataInitializer component.
